We have migrated the [repository](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg), the [issue tracker](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/wiki) to GitHub.

The Google Code project now only remains for reference (some info still need to be migrated: reference to downloads, project summary, etc, which will be done shortly).

# Presentation #

The **OpenJPEG library** is an open-source JPEG 2000 library developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000.

The main part of the project consists in a JPEG 2000 codec compliant with the Part 1 of the standard (Class-1 Profile-1 compliance).

Besides this **main codec**, OpenJPEG integrates several other modules:
  * **JP2** (JPEG 2000 standard Part 2 - Handling of JP2 boxes and extended multiple component transforms for multispectral and hyperspectral imagery)
  * **MJ2** (JPEG 2000 standard Part 3)
  * **JPWL** (JPEG 2000 standard Part 11)
  * **JPIP** (JPEG 2000 standard Part 9)
  * **OPJViewer**, a GUI viewer for J2K, JP2, JPWL and MJ2 files

The OpenJPEG library is written in C language, released under the BSD license and targets Win32, Unix and Mac OS platforms.

The library is developed by the Communications and Remote Sensing Lab ([TELE](http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be)) of the Universit√© catholique de Louvain ([UCL](http://www.uclouvain.be)), with the support of the [CS](http://www.c-s.fr/) company, the [CNES](http://www.cnes.fr/) and the [intoPIX](http://www.intopix.com) company.

The JPWL and OPJViewer modules are developed and maintained by the Digital Signal Processing Lab ([DSPLab](http://dsplab.diei.unipg.it/)) of the University of Perugia ([UNIPG](http://unipg.it/)).

Thanks to the constant contributions of many developers from the open source community, OpenJPEG has gained throughout the years in flexibility and performance. It is integrated in many open source applications, such as Second Life and Gimp.
