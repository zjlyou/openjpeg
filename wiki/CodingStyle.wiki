#summary OpenJPEG Coding Style

= Portability =

File should be pushed to server with UNIX eol

= C =

OpenJPEG is meant to be portable. OpenJPEG is using ANSI C.

There is one exception to this rule: large file support, since it requires C99. The build system is checking for LFS in the C compiler. In this case you need a C99 compiler to have LFS support in OpenJPEG

= Comment =

Because OpenJPEG is written in C. One should use C style comment: {{{/*}}} and {{{*/}}}

For doxygen, one should use {{{/**}}} and {{{*/}}}

= Open Questions =

 * What charset to use for unicode ? UTF-8 is a good contestant. Eg: "Università" in comment
 * tab spaces ? indent ? uncrutify rule ?
 * file type (UNIX eol would be nice)
