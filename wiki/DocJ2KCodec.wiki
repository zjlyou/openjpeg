=image_to_j2k=

==Description==

This program reads in an image of a certain type and converts it to a JPEG 2000 file. It is part of the OpenJPEG library.

==Usage==

{{{
image_to_j2k ... 
}}}

{{{
  -i <file>
}}}
  Input file. Either this argument or the -ImgDir argument described below is required. Valid input image extensions are BMP, PGM, PGX, PNG, PNM, PPM, RAW, TGA, TIF. For PNG  resp.  TIF, it needs libpng resp. libtiff. Concerning the BMP format, the coder accepts 24 bits color images and 8 bits (RLE or no-RLE) images. TIF files can have up to 16 bits per component. With RAW images, the -F parameter must be used (see below). In the case of raw images with a component depth comprised between 9 and 16 bits, each component data must be stored on two bytes, the first byte containing the MSBs and the second byte the LSBs. When using this option output file must be specified using -o.

{{{
  -o <file>
}}}
  Output file. Required when using -i option. Valid output image extensions are J2K, JP2, J2C.

{{{
  -ImgDir <directory_path>
}}}
  Path to the folder where the images to be compressed are stored. Either this argument or the -i argument described above is required. When Image files are in the same directory as the executable it can be indicated by a dot "." argument. When using this option, output format must be specified using -OutFor. The output codestreams are saved in the same folder.

{{{
  -OutFor <format>
}}}
  Output format used to compress the images read from the directory specified with -ImgDir. Required when -ImgDir option is used. Accepted formats are J2K, J2C, and JP2.

{{{
  -r <compression ratio>,<compression ratio>,...
}}}
  Compression ratio values. Each value is a factor of compression, thus 20 means 20 times compressed. Each value represents a quality layer. The order used to define the different levels of compression is important and must be from left to right in descending order. A final lossless quality layer will be signified by the value 1. Default: 1 single lossless quality layer.
 
{{{
  -q <quality in dB>,<quality in dB>,...
}}}
  Quality values. Each value is a psnr, to be given in dB, and represents a quality layer. The order used to define the different psnr-values is important and must be from left to right in ascending order. Default: 1 single lossless quality layer.

Multiple records may be supplied, in which case the first record refers to the highest resolution level and subsequent records to lower resolution levels. The last specified record is right-shifted for each remaining lower resolution levels. Default: 2^15^x2^15^ at each resolution.
 
{{{
  -t <tile width>,<tile height>
}}}
  Tile size. Default: the dimension of the whole image, thus only one tile.
 
{{{
  -I
}}} 
Irreversible compression (ICT + DWT 9-7). This option offers the possibility to work with the Irreversible Color Transformation (ICT) in place of the Reversible Color Transformation (RCT) and with the irreversible DWT 9-7 in place of the 5-3 filter. Default: off.

{{{
  -p <progression order>
}}}
  Progression order. The five progression orders are : LRCP, RLCP, RPCL, PCRL and CPRL. Default: LRCP.
 
{{{
  -cinema2K <24|48>
}}}
  Cinema2K profile.This option generates a codestream compliant to the Digital cinema specifications for a 2K resolution content. The value given is the frame rate which can be 24 or 48 fps. The main specifications of the JPEG Profile-3 (2K Digital Cinema Profile) are

{{{
  -POC T<tile number>=<res num start>,<comp num start>,<layer num end>,<res num end>,<comp num end>,<progression order> 
}}}
  Progression order change. This defines the bounds of resolution, color component, layer and progression order if a progression order change is desired. 

    Example:
    {{{
-POC T1=0,0,1,5,3,CPRL/T1=5,0,1,6,3,CPRL
    }}}
 
{{{
  -s <subX,subY>
}}}
  Subsampling factor. The value are respectively for X and Y axis. Value higher than 2 can be a source of error ! Default: no subsampling.
 
{{{
  -SOP
}}}
  SOP marker before each packet. This option offers the possibility to add a specific marker before each packet. Default: no SOP.
 
{{{
  -EPH
}}}
  EPH marker after each packet header. This option offers the possibility to add a specific marker at the head of each packet header. Default: no EPH.

{{{
  -M <key value>
}}}
  Switch modes. This option offers the possibility to use a mode switch during the encoding process. There are 6 modes switches:
    * BYPASS(LAZY) `[`1`]`
    * RESET `[`2`]`
    * RESTART(TERMALL) `[`4`]`
    * VSC `[`8`]`
    * ERTERM(SEGTERM) `[`16`]`
    * SEGMARK(SEGSYM)] `[`32`]`
  For several mode switch you have to add the value between `[``]`. Default: no mode switch.

  Example : RESTART(4) + RESET(2) + SEGMARK(32) => -M 38

{{{ 
-x <file>
}}}
  Index file. This index is a text file that summarizes the codestream. This index is useful to create a navigation process. 
    
    The index structure is the following
    {{{
<image width> <image height>
<progression order>
<tile width> <tile height>
<# components>
<# layers>
<# decompositions N> (= # resolutions -1)
[<precinct width for rN>,<precinct height for rN>],[<precinct width for r0>,<precinct height for r0>]
<main header end position>
<codestream size>
Foreach tile
{
<tile index> <start pos> <tile header end pos> <end pos> <total disto> <# pixels> <max MSE>
Note : 
  'total disto' is the sum of the distortion reductions brought by each packet belonging to this tile
  'max MSE' (=total disto/#pixels)
}
Foreach packet
{
<packet index> <tile index> <layer index> <res index> <comp index> <prec index> <start pos> <end pos> <disto>
}
<max disto on the whole image>
<total disto on the whole image>
    }}}

{{{
  -ROI c=<component index>,U=<upshifting value>
}}}
  Quantization indices upshifted for a component. Warning: This option does not implement the usual ROI (Region of Interest). It should be understood as a "Component of Interest". It offers the possibility to upshift the value of a component during quantization step. The value after c= is the component number [0, 1, 2, ...] and the value after U= is the value of upshifting. U must be in the range [0, 37].
 
{{{
  -d <off_X,off_Y>
}}}
  Offset of the image origin. The division in tile could be modified as the anchor point for tiling will be different than the image origin. However we must keep in mind that the offset of the image can not be higher than the tile dimension if the tile option is used. The 2 values are respectively for X and Y axis offset. Default: no offset.
 
{{{
  -T <off_X,off_Y>
}}}
  Offset of the tile origin. We must keep in mind that the tile anchor point can not be on the image area. The 2 values are respectively for X and Y axis offset. Default: no offset.
 
{{{
  -F <img width>,<img height>,<# components>,<bit-depth>,<s|u>
}}}
  Raw format specification. This option must be used when encoding an image stored under the RAW format. It defines the input image width, height, the number of components, the component bit depth and defines if the values are signed.

    Example of a 512x512 image with 3 unsigned components of 8 bits: 
    {{{
image_to_j2k -i lena.raw -o lena.j2k -F 512,512,3,8,u
    }}}

  As explained above, in the case of raw images with a component depth comprised between 9 and 16 bits, each component data must be stored on two bytes, the first byte containing the MSBs and the second byte the LSBs.

=j2k_to_image=

==Description==

This program reads in a jpeg2000 image and converts it to another image type. It is part of the OpenJPEG library.

       Valid input image extensions are .j2k, .jp2, .j2c, .jpt

       Valid output image extensions are .bmp, .pgm, .pgx, .png, .pnm, .ppm, .raw, .tga, .tif . For PNG resp.  TIF
       it needs libpng resp. libtiff .

==Usage==

{{{
j2k_to_image ... 
}}}

{{{
  -i <file>
}}}
  Input file. Either this argument or the -ImgDir argument described below is required. Valid input image extensions are J2K, JP2, JPC, JPT. When using this option output file must be specified using -o.

{{{
  -o <file>
}}}
  Output file. Required when using -i option. Currently accepts BMP, TIF, RAW, TGA, PGM, PPM, PNM and PGX files. Binary data is written to the file (not ascii). If a PGX filename is given, there will be as many output files as there are components: an indice starting from 0 will then be appended to the output filename, just before the "pgx" extension. If a PGM filename is given and there are more than one component, only the first component will be written to the file.

{{{
  -ImgDir <directory_path>
}}}
  Path to the folder where the compressed images are stored. Either this argument or the -i argument described above is required. When Image files are in the same directory as the executable it can be indicated by a dot "." argument. When using this option, output format must be specified using -OutFor. The output images are saved in the same folder.

{{{
  -OutFor <format>
}}}
  Output format used to decompress the codestreams read from the directory specified with -ImgDir. Required when -ImgDir option is used. Currently accepts TIF, RAW, TGA, PGM, PPM, PNM, PGX and BMP format.

{{{
  -r <reduce factor>
}}}
  Reduce factor. Set the number of highest resolution levels to be discarded. The image resolution is effectively divided by 2 to the power of the number of discarded levels. The reduce factor is limited by the smallest total number of decomposition levels among tiles.

{{{
  -l <layer number>
}}}
  Layer number. Set the maximum number of quality layers to decode. If there are less quality layers than the specified number, all the quality layers are decoded.

{{{ 
-x <file>
}}}
  Index file. This index is a text file that summarizes the codestream. This index is useful to create a navigation process. It is identical to the one created at the encoder side, except that there is no distortion information.

{{{
  -h 
}}}
  Print a help message and exit.

See JPWL OPTIONS for special options

==JPWL options==

Following option is available only if the library has been compiled with the jpwl source files (located in './libopenjpeg/jpwl' and with the 'USE_JPWL' flag). 

{{{
  -W [c,c=<numcomps>]
}}}
  Adoption of JPWL (Part 11) capabilities. Activates the JPEG2000 for Wireless LANs (Part 11) correction capabilities, if the codestream has been prepared accordingly (i.e. -W switch at the encoder). Options can be a comma separated list of <param=val> tokens:

    * c,c=`<numcomps>`
    numcomps is the number of expected components in the codestream (search of first EPB rely upon this, default is 3).
