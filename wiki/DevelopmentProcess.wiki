#summary Development process for the openjpeg project : trunk, branches and tags management


==Versioning rules==
_OpenJPEG version (MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO)_

  * MAJOR incremented in case of API break (MINOR and MICRO set to 0),
  * MINOR incremented in case of API addition (MAJOR unchanged, MICRO set to 0),
  * MICRO incremented in case of bugfixes not impacting the API (MAJOR, MINOR unchanged).


==Tags and branches==
Based on the current development pace of OpenJPEG, the following use of branches and tags is proposed:

  * The trunk always corresponds to the version in development.
  * When an API break is scheduled (new major version) and is started being developed, a branch is created just before breaking the API. This newly created branch will host all subsequent bugfixes applying to the old major version. 
  * When an API is added or bugfixes not impacting the API are made, no new branch is created.
  * When a new version (major, minor or micro) is released, a tag is created in the corresponding branch (or in the trunk if it concerns the version in development).

In summary, branching would be used only in case of a future major release.

Concerning the current state of the SVN, we are in the process of merging the v2 branch with the trunk. Just before committing the changes, we'll create a new branch to host release 1.5 and future 1.5.x releases. After the merge, the v2 branch will become obsolete and all development should be done in the trunk.
